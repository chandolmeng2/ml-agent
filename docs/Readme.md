# First Ranger â€“ A Simulation Project Based on Unity ML-Agents

**First Ranger** is a simulation game developed using the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit.  
The project aims to simulate the duties of a national park ranger, implementing reinforcement learning-based NPC AI behaviors.

## Key Features

- NPC behavior trained with Unity ML-Agents reinforcement learning  
- A raccoon agent trained to escape from the player using reinforcement learning  
- Environment randomization and curriculum learning for complex tasks  
- Simulation scenarios based on real-world ranger missions
